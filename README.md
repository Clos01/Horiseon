Horiseon challenge 
Some of the improvements I did to improve the website included changing the way it appears on the tab; it was previously labeled "website," but I changed it to "Welcome to Horiseon." I used semantic html to provide search engines and website speech readers a better grasp of the page. I organized the code in a sequential sequence to make it simpler to understand and eliminated certain problems, such as the search engine optimization section, which would not send you to that area of the website unless you clicked on it; I rectified this by adding the id attribute.I noticed a lot of similarities in the styles. css folder, so I structured the css first by adding comments, and if I noticed that various classes used the same components, I stacked them so they wouldn't be duplicated and take up additional lines. I made sure that everything was readable and accessible, and that the comments were simple to comprehend.
